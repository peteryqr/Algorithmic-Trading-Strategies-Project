# Algorithmic-Trading-Strategies-Project

## References

This project was inspired by and references the following sources:

- In Metrics-based_Investment_Screening_Project, the core framework of this project was adapted from the YouTube video "Algorithmic Trading Using Python - Full Course" by freeCodeCamp.org, which is a comprehensive guide of quantitative trading for beginners. You can view the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f73ItMWO4z8).

- In Mean_Reversion_Project, the major methods and strategies are inspired by the YouTube video "Quant Strategy: Pairs Trading Algorithm (Mean Reversion)" by Spencer Pao, which is a informative introduction to Mean Reversion(Pair Trading) strategy in quantitative trading. You can view the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f73ItMWO4z8).


- I have also utilized ideas and code snippets from various public repositories and discussions within the developer and trading community, particularly forums like Stack Overflow and ChatGPT.

The adaptations and extensions I made to the borrowed ideas have been documented in the commit messages throughout the development of this project.
